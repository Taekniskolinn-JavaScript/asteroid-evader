# Asteroid Evader

This game originated at [UtahJS](http://www.meetup.com/UtahJS/events/220294554/) as I was coding along with [Steve Taylor](https://twitter.com/gostay) as he gave a talk on HTML5 games. It has since evolved into what you see now. His original work can be found [here](http://wahoo.com/play/html5in45/).
